## Meta

Each page should have a `meta` object with the following fields:
- `title`: the name of the encounter (or dungeon, etc.)
- `type`: the type of the encounter (e.g. `dungeon`, `raid`, `trial`, etc.)
- `difficulty`: the difficulty of the encounter (e.g. `normal`, `hard`, `lunatic`, `chaos`, etc.)
- `alias`: an optional array of alias for the post (e.g. `['matoya', 'relict', 'porxie', 'pig']`)

## Colours

When setting the color of a trigger, use the following colours:

- ðŸ”µ **Blue** = useful information - mechanics, positioning
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** = warnings
- ðŸ”´ **Red** = critical warnings
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple** = debuffs

## Triggers

Triggers can be used when a specific condition needs to occur before knowledge becomes useful. This could be the cast of a spell, or the appearance of a debuff.

An example of a trigger is:

```mdx
<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Spell Name" color="orange">
    <Consequence>A monkey appears and then dances for you</Consequence>
</Trigger>
```

Triggers consist of 2 parts:
- the type of the trigger: e.g. "on cast", "before cast", "when", "after", "on text"
- the trigger name - e.g. "Spell Name", "Tethered"

Examples:
- **on cast**: when a spell is cast
- **on debuff**: when a debuff appears
- **on tether**: when a tether is applied

## Alerts

Alerts are useful for overall encounter knowledge; don't use them for mechanics or specific trigger information

<Alert color="green" icon="warning">
    Helpful hints such as "Boss is unaffected by enmity and cannot be tanked"
</Alert>

<Alert color="orange" icon="warning">
    Important warnings such as "Kill both bosses at the same time"
</Alert>

<Alert color="red" icon="warning">
    Critical warnings such as "Don't fall off the edge <Consequence>or you will die</Consequence>"
</Alert>

## Nested Triggers

Nested triggers can be used to group logic or when several paths can occur.

<Trigger type="on" trigger={ <>Marked with <PlusIcon/> plus or <MinusIcon /> minus icon</> }>
    **Mnemonic**: reverse magnet

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Same symbol as ally" color="green">
        Stand close to ally and center
    </Trigger>

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Different symbol to ally" color="red">
        Stand far away from ally
    </Trigger>
</Trigger>

<Trigger type="on" trigger={ <>Marked with <PlusIcon/> plus or <MinusIcon /> minus icon</> }>
    **Mnemonic**: reverse magnet

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Same symbol as boss" color="green">
        Stand close to boss
    </Trigger>

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Different symbol to boss" color="red">
        Stand far away from boss
    </Trigger>
</Trigger>
