## Meta

Each page should have a `meta` object with the following fields:
- `title`: the name of the encounter (or dungeon, etc.)
- `type`: the type of the encounter (e.g. `dungeon`, `raid`, `trial`, etc.)
- `difficulty`: the difficulty of the encounter (e.g. `normal`, `hard`, `extreme`, `savage`, etc.)
- `alias`: an optional array of alias for the post (e.g. `['matoya', 'relict', 'porxie', 'pig']`)

## Triggers

Triggers can be used when a specific condition needs to occur before knowledge becomes useful. This could be the cast of a spell, or the appearance of a debuff.

An example of a trigger is:

```mdx
<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Dance Monkey Dance" color="orange">
    `/clap` to the dancing monkey
</Trigger>
```

<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Dance Monkey Dance" color="orange">
    `/clap` to the dancing monkey
</Trigger>

Examples:
- **on cast**: when a spell is cast
- **on debuff**: when a debuff appears
- **on tether**: when a tether is applied
- **on text**: when text is shown to the player
- **on spawn**: when an add spawns
- **before cast**: before a spell is cast
- **after cast**: after a spell is cast

Triggers should not be written for everything, any obvious mechanic such as stack markers should not be included. Unavoidable damage such as tankbusters or party-wide damage should similarly not be included.

Trigger information should be short and concise, focusing on key information that is actionable by the player. If something is not actionable such having an AoE or tankbuster marked, it should not be included.

## Colours

When setting the color of a trigger, use the following colours:

- ðŸ”µ **Blue** = useful information - mechanics, positioning
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** = warnings
- ðŸ”´ **Red** = critical warnings
- ðŸŸ£ **Purple** = debuffs

## Alerts

Alerts are useful for overall encounter knowledge; don't use them for mechanics or specific trigger information

<Alert color="green" icon="warning">
    Helpful hints such as "Boss is unaffected by enmity and cannot be tanked"
</Alert>

<Alert color="orange" icon="warning">
    Important warnings such as "Kill both bosses at the same time"
</Alert>

<Alert color="red" icon="warning">
    Critical warnings such as "Don't fall off the edge <Consequence>or you will die</Consequence>"
</Alert>

## Nested Triggers

Nested triggers can be used to group logic or when several paths can occur.

<Trigger type="on" trigger={ <>Marked with <PlusIcon/> plus or <MinusIcon /> minus icon</> }>
    **Mnemonic**: reverse magnet

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Same symbol as ally" color="green">
        Stand close to ally and center
    </Trigger>

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Different symbol to ally" color="red">
        Stand far away from ally
    </Trigger>
</Trigger>

<Trigger type="on" trigger={ <>Marked with <PlusIcon/> plus or <MinusIcon /> minus icon</> }>
    **Mnemonic**: reverse magnet

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Same symbol as boss" color="green">
        Stand close to boss
    </Trigger>

    <Trigger type="if" trigger="Different symbol to boss" color="red">
        Stand far away from boss
    </Trigger>
</Trigger>
