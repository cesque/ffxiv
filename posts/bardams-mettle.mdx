## Bardam

Non-combat - no attacking, just successfully dodge the mechanics

### Phase 1

<Trigger color="orange" type="on cast" trigger="Travail">
    Stand at edge of first AoE, then walk towards centre to dodge second AoE
</Trigger>

<Trigger color="blue" type="on cast" trigger="Spear charge">
    Dodge checkerboard attacks by walking diagonally between two empty squares
</Trigger>

<Trigger color="red" type="on cast" trigger="Empty Gaze">
    Face away from the boss

    Will be cast during the above two abilities, but you can dodge those by walking backwards anyway
</Trigger>

### Phase 2

When the boss casts **Travail (firestorm)**, AoEs will spawn following players, but these are easy enough to avoid

<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Heavy strike">
    Stand behind boss, in the non-indicated quarter
</Trigger>

<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Star fall">
    Stand either in centre or somewhere on outer edge
</Trigger>

### Phase 3

<Trigger color="red" type="before" trigger="Meteor falls">
    Stand behind the final star shard (either north or south will still be available)
</Trigger>

## Yol

<Trigger type="on cast" trigger="Eye of the Fierce">
    Face away from boss (gaze attack)
</Trigger>
